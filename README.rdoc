== Timesheet

A simple personal time tracking app written in Rails, suitable for
freelancers and other individuals who need to keep track of the time
spent on individual projects.

Key aims are usability on mobile devices and meaningful exports of CSV data.

Neither of those aims have yet been achieved though!
